  <h2 class="text">Hello, and thanks for stopping by! I'm a first year graphic design major here. I don't do much around campus, however in my free time I enjoy such endeavors as creating weird (and some normal) art, 3D printing, playing video games, and partaking in other nonsense.</h2>
  <h2 class="text">Oh, and I also love well-done comedy (and some other genres of) music, movies, shows, books, and any other form I can take it in (some of which may be in the links if you're lucky). I'll take Douglas Adams over George Orwell any day.</h2>
  <h2 class="text">Guess I misjudged how much space was left when I wrote that last one. What I get for using a taller image I suppose. What else is there? Oh yeah! I'd love to design aloha (Hawaiian) shirt patterns for a living. Specifically with a company like RSVLTS would be cool, but I'll see where time leads me.</h2>
